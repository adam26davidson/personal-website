In the mean time, you could check out my harmony visualizer with the link below. It uses lisajous figures to visualize the relationships between notes. More harmonic frequency relationships result in more stable shapes. Try adding more than 3 notes into the mix and you will see a 2d projection of higher dimensional shapes. On the site you can turn on the sound with the button in the upper right hand side of the page.
